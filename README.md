# Blockchain-based-Carbon-Credit-Trading-Platoform

Despite the potential benefits of carbon credits, current trading systems are often complex, fragmented, and lack transparency. This can lead to inefficiencies, fraud, and limited participation in the market, undermining the effectiveness of carbon credits in mitigating climate change. In addition, the average household, which is responsible for around 20-40% of global greenhouse gas emissions, is not currently participating in carbon offset programs due to the complexity of the process. There is a pressing need for a more inclusive and accessible platform that can facilitate carbon credit trading and encourage broader participation.


# Advantages of Using Blockchain for Carbon Credit Management and Trading
 
1. Enhanced Transparency and Trust: Providing an immutable and publicly accessible record of all transactions can foster trust among market participants and encourage wider adoption of carbon trading. The data stored on the ledger is unchangeable after validation and is easily traceable in a supply chain with the origin of the carbon credits being known.

2. Improved Security: Blockchain technology is resistant to fraud, hacking, and unauthorised access. This increased security can encourage more organisations and individuals to participate in the market. The need for multi-party trust is also reduced and third-party intermediaries such as banks are eliminated because the whole transaction is transparent.

3. Streamlined Verification and Tracking: Blockchain eliminates double counting when more than one firm claims the same emission reductions. Blockchain can simplify the process of verifying and tracking carbon credits and emission reductions, reducing the complexity and costs associated with traditional carbon trading models.

4. Greater Inclusivity: The platform can be more inclusive to individual households and smaller organisations allowing them to participate in the market and contribute to climate change mitigation efforts.

5. Interoperability: The platform can potentially facilitate interoperability between different carbon markets, standards, and regulations, helping to address the fragmentation issue that currently hampers the growth and efficiency of the carbon market.

In summary, the application of blockchain technology to carbon credit trading can address many of the challenges and limitations of traditional models, leading to a more accessible, transparent, and efficient market that can better contribute to climate change mitigation efforts.

# The Technical Architecture of the Carbon Credit Trading Platform 

1.	Blockchain Selection and Consensus Algorithm: We will use the Ethereum blockchain due to its extensive support for smart contracts and the established ecosystem. Ethereum has transitioned from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm. PoS is more energy-efficient and has lower transaction costs, making it suitable for a carbon credit trading platform. Validators will be required to stake a certain amount of Ether (ETH) to participate in the consensus process.

2.	Smart Contracts: We will develop and deploy a suite of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain to enable carbon credit token creation, trading, burning, and management of green project investments.
a. Carbon Credit Token Contract (ERC-20): This contract will manage the minting, burning, and trading of carbon credit tokens. It will store token balances and provide functions for transferring tokens between wallets.
b. Green Project Investment Contract: This contract will manage user deposits of stablecoins (e.g., USDT, DAI) and facilitate investments in pre-approved green projects. The contract will track the progress of each project and release carbon tokens to investors based on achieved milestones.
c. Decentralised Exchange (DEX) Contract: This contract will handle the trading of carbon tokens on an Automated Market Maker (AMM) model. The AMM will use liquidity pools, which are funded by users who deposit both carbon tokens and a corresponding stablecoin or cryptocurrency. In return for providing liquidity, these users will earn a percentage of the trading fees generated by the platform.
d. Community Incentives Contract: This contract will manage rewards for users participating in sponsored challenges and campaigns in partnership with local governments and businesses.

3.	Carbon Credit Verification and Token Minting: Carbon credit generators will submit their projects for validation by accredited verifiers. Once verified, the project details and the amount of carbon credits generated will be stored on the blockchain. The Carbon Credit Token Contract will then mint carbon tokens corresponding to the total carbon credits generated and distribute them to the project's wallet.

4.	Integration with Local Governments and Businesses: Local governments and businesses can propose sponsored challenges and campaigns through a web-based interface that interacts with the platform's smart contracts. These partners will fund the rewards for users by depositing carbon tokens or stablecoins into the platform.

5.	Decentralized Exchange (DEX) and Automated Market Maker (AMM): The platform will use a DEX to enable carbon credit token trading. An AMM model will be employed to provide liquidity, enabling users to trade tokens without relying on traditional order books. Liquidity providers will deposit pairs of tokens (e.g., carbon credit tokens and a stablecoin) into the AMM's liquidity pool, earning fees for facilitating trades.

6.	User Interface (Web and Mobile): Users will access the platform through web and mobile applications that interact with the Ethereum blockchain and the platform's smart contracts. Users can create accounts, connect their Ethereum wallets, view available challenges and campaigns, participate in community-driven projects, trade carbon tokens, and invest in green projects.

7.	Off-chain Components: Some aspects of the platform may need to be managed off-chain, such as user registration and authentication, project submission and verification, and communication between users and project stakeholders. Off-chain storage solutions like the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) can be used for this purpose. Oracles will be employed to provide trusted external data to the platform, such as carbon emission rates, project progress updates, and market data.

8.	Governance and Upgradability: The platform will have a governance token that allows token holders to vote on proposed changes and upgrades to the platform. This ensures that the platform remains decentralized and can adapt to new market conditions, regulatory requirements, or technological advancements.

9.	Security and Auditing: The smart contracts and web/mobile applications will undergo extensive security testing and auditing by independent third-party experts to ensure the platform's integrity and safety for users and investors.

# Tokenomics and Economic Model of the Platform

The tokenization of carbon credits involves representing the information and utility of a physical carbon credit on a blockchain as a token (Khodai, 2022). Broadly speaking, there are two tokenization methods: bridging and native tokenization.
●	Bridging, which can be subclassified into custodial and non-custodial, requires that physical carbon credits are issued first, and then transferred onto a blockchain by a bridging process.
a.	Custodial bridging requires a centralised third party, such as a verifier or issuer, to bridge all tokens for all participants. This is heavily dependent on platform participants conferring a great degree of trust in the centralised party.
b.	Non-custodial means that each individual user bridges their own physical credits into tokens. This is a more decentralised method and doesn’t rely on network participants putting their trust in a centralised entity.
●	Native tokenization is whereby the tokens are issued directly onto the blockchain, without physical credits having been issued beforehand.
Each tokenization method has its own benefits and drawbacks, but our platform, CarbonXChange, will use native tokenization because it doesn’t require participants to confer their trust to a centralised third party. Furthermore, all information would be stored in a single source of truth within which information cannot be changed or destroyed, only updated. However, it must be considered that native tokenization means that no physical credits are issued, and thus it may decrease the pool of willing participants, especially those who have reservations about the safety of blockchain.

# Pricing for Carbon Credit Tokens and Trading Fees

There are three ways of pricing a token at ICO:

1. Static supply and price – This entails that both the supply of tokens and the price per token are predefined.
2. Static supply and dynamic price – This is whereby there is a predefined supply of tokens, but that the price per token is calculated by dividing the number of tokens being issued by the total pool of funds raised at ICO.
3. Dynamic supply and static price – This means that the price per token is predefined, but that the number of tokens issued is determined by the amount of funding received. 
Our ICO will follow a static supply and price, whereby the supply will be determined by the number of credits being generated by backed projects, and the price will be determined by the price of the underlying credits at the time of offering. 
With physical carbon credits, there is a degree of illiquidity due to the idiosyncrasies of each project and their respective credits which differ by vintage, type of project, geographic location, etc. Therefore, in order to provide greater liquidity, our tokens will be pooled based on the type of project from which they were generated. Similar approaches have been adopted by other carbon credit token networks such as Toucan and Flowcarbon.
Three baseline fees will be imposed to ensure financial and climate viability:
1.	Transaction fee for trading - A 1% transaction fee on the trading of tokens will be imposed in order to ensure the financial viability of the project. 
2.	A fee for minting tokens on the blockchain - Minting tokens requires computational resources and energy. Therefore, to cover these costs, a small fee is typically charged for each token minted. The exact amount can vary based on several factors, including the complexity of the minting process, the current load on the network, and the price of the underlying cryptocurrency (Ethereum in this case). This fee also serves as a deterrent for spamming the network with unnecessary token creation.
3.	A further fee on the retirement/redemption of tokens (Burning) - This fee will be imposed when redeeming/retiring tokens in order to cover the project’s energy, thus ensuring that the project is beneficial to the environment. This fee will be insignificant, as the tokens will be running on Ethereum 2.0, which uses a proof-of-stake algorithm, which consumes 99% less energy than proof-of-work systems.
The pricing and fee structure is kept transparent and clearly communicated to all participants to maintain trust in the platform and to ensure users understand the costs associated with participating in the carbon credit marketplace.

# Incentives for Users and Reward Distribution

Individuals who participate in projects will be rewarded by receiving a proportion of the mined tokens. Of the total amount of mined tokens, we anticipate that 90% will be distributed for purchase and trade, and the remaining 10% will be allocated to project participants.
Beyond making a positive climate impact, there are numerous incentives for users to participate in the network:
1. CSR Adherence: Particularly for businesses, participation in a positive climate project such as this can be a key source of CSR adherence.
2. 	It is possible that royalties could be programmed into the tokens to reward the project developers – this could replace the initial system of rewarding participants with mined tokens.
3. 	Creation of new derivative markets: Opens up a new possibility for derivative markets, such as options and forwards, backed by the carbon credit tokens.
4.	CCTs as a treasury/investment asset: The tokens can be used as a treasury and/or investment asset – this is particularly pertinent for early-stage network participants, as it is anticipated that the demand for carbon credit tokens may increase by a factor of 15 by 2030, and up to 100 by 2050, which could see the market value be upward of $50bn by 2030. As such it is reasonable to expect that certain users may trade tokens in a buy-and-hold manner, as a means of hedging against more volatile assets such as stocks. Furthermore, this is of significant current interest, following announcements from Morgan Stanley, BlackRock and Goldman Sachs of their intentions to move away from a 60/40 equity/bond portfolio split, and move towards different investment assets; it is not unreasonable to suggest carbon credit tokens may attract the attention of such wealth/asset management firms.
