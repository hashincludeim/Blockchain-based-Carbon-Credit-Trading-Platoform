# Blockchain-based-Carbon-Credit-Trading-Platoform

Despite the potential benefits of carbon credits, current trading systems are often complex, fragmented, and lack transparency. This can lead to inefficiencies, fraud, and limited participation in the market, undermining the effectiveness of carbon credits in mitigating climate change. In addition, the average household, which is responsible for around 20-40% of global greenhouse gas emissions, is not currently participating in carbon offset programs due to the complexity of the process. There is a pressing need for a more inclusive and accessible platform that can facilitate carbon credit trading and encourage broader participation.


# Advantages of Using Blockchain for Carbon Credit Management and Trading
Figure 4: Key Advantages 
 
Enhanced Transparency and Trust: Providing an immutable and publicly accessible record of all transactions (Dr. Saraji & Dr. Borowczak, 2021) can foster trust among market participants and encourage wider adoption of carbon trading. The data stored on the ledger is unchangeable after validation and is easily traceable in a supply chain with the origin of the carbon credits being known (Wang, Wang and Abareshi, 2020).
Improved Security: Blockchain technology is resistant to fraud, hacking, and unauthorised access. This increased security can encourage more organisations and individuals to participate in the market (Digital Asset Research, 2022). The need for multi-party trust is also reduced and third-party intermediaries such as banks are eliminated because the whole transaction is transparent (Wang, Wang and Abareshi, 2020).
Streamlined Verification and Tracking: Blockchain eliminates double counting when more than one firm claims the same emission reductions (Vives, 2023). Blockchain can simplify the process of verifying and tracking carbon credits and emission reductions, reducing the complexity and costs associated with traditional carbon trading models (Dr. Saraji & Dr. Borowczak, 2021).
Greater Inclusivity: The platform can be more inclusive to individual households and smaller organisations allowing them to participate in the market and contribute to climate change mitigation efforts (Dubois et al., 2019).
Interoperability: The platform can potentially facilitate interoperability between different carbon markets, standards, and regulations, helping to address the fragmentation issue that currently hampers the growth and efficiency of the carbon market (Sovacool, 2011).
In summary, the application of blockchain technology to carbon credit trading can address many of the challenges and limitations of traditional models, leading to a more accessible, transparent, and efficient market that can better contribute to climate change mitigation efforts.
